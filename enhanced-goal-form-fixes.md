# Enhanced Goal Form Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Activity Selection Issue**: The activity wasn't being properly detected when opening the Add Goal form.
2. **Date Input Issues**: The start and end date fields were not being populated with default values.
3. **Target Count Default**: The target count was defaulting to 1, which was too low.

## Multiple Layers of Fixes

We've implemented a comprehensive, multi-layered approach to ensure these issues are fixed with maximum reliability:

### Layer 1: Direct HTML Override

Created `override-goal-form-html.js` which:
- Completely replaces the goal form HTML with a version that has:
  - Start date pre-filled with today's date
  - End date pre-filled with 30 days from today
  - Target count pre-filled with 10
  - Rebuilt form elements to eliminate any issues

### Layer 2: Specialized Date Field Fix

Created `fix-goal-date-fields.js` which:
- Uses a MutationObserver to detect when the form becomes visible
- Forces the date values to be set using multiple DOM techniques:
  - Direct value assignment
  - defaultValue property
  - setAttribute method
  - Event dispatching for input and change events
- Rechecks the dates at regular intervals (300ms)

### Layer 3: Enhanced Goal Form Complete Fix

Enhanced `fix-goal-form-complete.js` to:
- Use more aggressive current activity detection
- Force default date setting regardless of validation state
- Implement a direct submission handler that ensures dates are set
- Add a form check interval to continuously monitor and fix the form
- Expose a global API for other scripts to force showing the form

### Layer 4: Inline Script Improvements

Enhanced the inline scripts in the HTML to:
- Provide improved setDefaultDates function
- Use multiple techniques to set dates (value, defaultValue, setAttribute)
- Add a MutationObserver directly in the HTML head section

### Layer 5: Last Resort Emergency Fix

Enhanced the emergency fix script at the bottom of the HTML to:
- Format dates properly with a helper function
- Check for empty date fields during its interval checks
- Force set dates if found to be empty

## Technical Approaches Used

### Activity Detection

- First tries the activity dropdown (most reliable source)
- Falls back to global variables (window.currentActivity, app.currentActivity)
- Checks the app title and other UI elements
- Creates a fallback default if no activity can be found

### Date Setting

Used multiple approaches to set dates:
1. Direct HTML attributes in the form template
2. JavaScript value property: `input.value = dateStr`
3. defaultValue property: `input.defaultValue = dateStr`
4. setAttribute: `input.setAttribute('value', dateStr)`
5. valueAsDate property: `input.valueAsDate = dateObj`
6. Event dispatching: Triggering 'input' and 'change' events
7. Continuously checking and correcting: Multiple intervals and observers

### Form Submission Protection

- Added validation to ensure dates are set before submission
- Added a fallback to force set dates during the submission process
- Added error handling to recover from submission failures

## Testing Instructions

1. Open the Actrak application
2. Select an activity
3. Click "Add Goal"
4. Verify the form shows:
   - The correct activity name
   - Target count of 10
   - Today's date as start date
   - A date 30 days in the future as end date
5. Submit the form and verify the goal is created correctly

## Future Improvements

1. Add dedicated unit tests for the goal form functionality
2. Refactor to a more centralized date and form management approach 
3. Simplify the codebase by removing the need for multiple fix layers
4. Add visual feedback during date setting/validation
