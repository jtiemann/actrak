# Target Count Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The target count entered by users in the Add/Edit Goal form is not being correctly saved and used in goal progress calculations. This happens because:

1. Multiple competing form submission handlers are overriding each other
2. The value from the input field is not being correctly captured at submission time
3. The form reset operations are interfering with user input

## Solution Approach

I've created a specialized fix (`fix-goal-target-count.js`) that focuses specifically on the target count issue, using a multi-layered approach:

### 1. Form Submission Interception

- Completely replaces the form element with a fresh copy to clear all existing event handlers
- Adds a dedicated form submission handler that runs in the capture phase (before other handlers)
- Directly reads the target count value from the input field at submission time
- Logs the target count value at each step to provide debugging information

### 2. Target Count Value Preservation

- Adds input event tracking to log when the target count value changes
- Monitors focus and blur events to track when the user interacts with the field
- Patches the `setDefaultTargetCount` function to only set defaults when truly needed (empty or zero)
- Ensures user input is never overwritten by automatic behaviors

### 3. Direct API Communication

- Bypasses the GoalsManager for form submission to avoid interference
- Makes API calls directly to the server with the correct target count value
- Properly formats the target count as a number to ensure correct processing
- Handles both create and update operations

### 4. Validation and Error Handling

- Validates the target count before submission to ensure it's a valid number greater than zero
- Shows clear error messages to the user if validation fails
- Includes comprehensive error handling for API calls
- Provides visual feedback during the submission process

### 5. Reactivity and State Management

- Uses a MutationObserver to detect when the form becomes visible
- Reapplies fixes whenever the form is shown
- Adds event listeners to the Add Goal button to ensure fixes are applied consistently
- Ensures form reset operations don't clear user input

## Implementation Details

The key aspects of the implementation are:

1. **Dedicated Form Submission Handler**:
   ```javascript
   newForm.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
     e.preventDefault();
     e.stopImmediatePropagation();
     
     const targetInput = document.getElementById('goal-target-count');
     const targetCount = parseFloat(targetInput.value);
     
     // Validation and direct API call with the correct value
     ...
   }, true); // true = capture phase
   ```

2. **Value Tracking and Preservation**:
   ```javascript
   targetInput.addEventListener('input', function() {
     console.log(`[Goal Target Count Fix] Target count changed to: ${this.value}`);
   });
   ```

3. **Direct API Calls**:
   ```javascript
   // Ensure targetCount is properly parsed as a number
   const targetCount = parseFloat(targetInput.value);
   
   // Send with the correct data type
   body: JSON.stringify({
     userId,
     activityTypeId: activityId,
     targetCount,  // Properly parsed number
     ...
   })
   ```

## Testing

1. Open the Add Goal form
2. Enter a custom target count (e.g., 25, 50, or 100)
3. Submit the form
4. View the created goal and verify the target shows the correct value
5. Check the progress calculation to ensure it uses the correct target count

## Additional Benefits

- Improved logging for debugging
- Better error messages for users
- More robust handling of edge cases
- Preservation of user input even when automatic functions run
